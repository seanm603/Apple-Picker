# Apple-Picker
Apple Picker is based on the classic Atari game "Kaboom!". An AppleTree moves back and forth dropping Apples that players attempt to catch with three Baskets. Each Apple that is caught by the player is worth 100 points. If the player misses one Apple, then all apples on screen disappear, the player loses one Basket, and the game continues.
